Programming Project - Old Lady
Building Java Programs: Programming Project 1.3
Objective: Students will write a program that prints the song ‘There was an Old Lady’ to the console.
Students will minimize repetition in their code by writing multiple methods. The lyrics to the song can be
found in the textbook on page 58.

Compiling: Programs that do not compile will be returned to the student to be debugged.
Comments: When you think you have enough comments, add more comments. Any member of your
family should be able to read your code and understand its purpose.
Output: Programs that produce partially correct output may receive partial credit in this category
Late work: Assignments may be turned one week late for half credit.
How to turn in your assignment:
1. Find the assignment that has been posted on Edmodo.
2. Click ‘Turn In’. Find your OldLady.java file. Attach it to your submission.
3. Using the rubric, grade your own submission and post your score in Edmodo. Mr. Stride will also
grade your project.

There was an old lady who swalloweda fly
| don’t know why she
swallowed the fly
Perhaps she'll die
There was an old lady who swallowed a spider
That wiggled and jiggled and tickled inside her
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly
| don’t know why she
swallowed the fly
Perhaps she'll die
There was an old lady who swallowed a bird
How absurd! She swalloweda bird!
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly
| don’t know why she
swallowed the fly
Perhaps she'll die
There was an old lady who swallowed a cat
Imagine that! She swallowed a cat
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly
| don’t know why she
swallowed the fly
Perhaps she'll die
There was an old lady who swallowed a dog
She went whole hog to swallow the dog
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly
| don’t know why she
swallowed the fly
Perhaps she'll die
There was an old lady who swallowed a cow
| don’t know how she swallowed the cow
She swallowed the cow to catch the dog
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly
| don’t know why she
swallowed the fly
Perhaps she'll die
There was an old lady who swallowed a horse
She died, of course
It was the last course
I’m filled with remorse
What's left to say
Even the artist is crying
We'll miss her dearly
It's such a loss
She had no time to floss
She missed out on the sauce
Moral: Never swallow a horse
